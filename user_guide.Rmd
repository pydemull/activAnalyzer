# Section 1: Assessor’s information
It is possible to provide title, name, and surname information related to the assessor. Assessor’s information must be provided to have a complete document when generating the report at the end of the app.

# Section 2: Patient’s information
It is possible to provide title, name, and surname information related to the patient/client, as well as their sex, age, and weight. The user must provide sex, age, and weight information for getting results because these parameters are used to compute basal metabolic rate as well as physical activity level. Patient’s information must be provided to have a complete document when generating the report at the end of the app.

# Section 3: Device's information
It is possible to provide the name of the ActiGraph model that was used for the measurement, as well as the position where data were recorded, the sampling rate, and the filter enabled when generating the .agd file from .gt3x data with Actilife® software. Several options are available for the position but for now, the app is designed to work with data recorded at the hip only. Device's information must be provided to have a complete document when generating the report at the end of the app. Such information is important to fully understand the results and to verify that within- and between patient/client measurements comparisons are possible.

# Section 4: Data uploading, nonwear time detection, and data visualization
In this section, the user must upload a .agd file generated using Actilife<span>&#174;</span> software. The length of the epoch used in the .agd file (e.g., 10 s, 60 s) has no importance. Once a .agd file is uploaded, behind the scene, the app collapses the data to get a dataframe with 1-min epochs thanks to the `PhysicalActivity` R package [@choiAssessmentWearNonwear2012]. Then, it is possible to configure the analysis performed to detect nonwear time. It consists of choosing the activity data (vector magnitude counts or vertical axis counts) and the time interval to be considered to detect nonwear time, as well as the time interval with nonzero counts allowed during a nonwear period. The default values provided in the app for configuring nonwear time detection are based on the paper by Choi et al. [-@choiAssessmentWearNonwear2012]. Finally, when all inputs are configured as required, the user must click on a "Validate configuration" button. If all inputs are valid, the app detects nonwear time again thanks to the `PhysicalActivity` R package [@choiAssessmentWearNonwear2012], and provides a graphic allowing the user to visualize different metrics among those contained in the initial data file. Completing this step is required before going further in the app.
