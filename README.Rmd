# Overview

activAnalyzer is a shinny app that was developed to analyse ActiGraph accelerometer data (.agd files) recorded at the hip in adults. Once analysis is completed, the app allows to export results to .csv files and to generate a report of the measurement (.pdf file). All the configured inputs relevant for interpreting the results are recorded in the report. Be sure that the inputs that are configured when generating the report correspond to the analysis that was actually performed (in other words, avoid modifying the inputs after generating satisfactory results). Please read the [user's guide](https://github.com/pydemull/activAnalyzer/blob/master/inst/guide/user_guide_en.pdf) for details about how the app works.

# Usage

For now, this app can be used following two different ways: (i) on the web via a [shinyapps.io plateform] (pydemull.shinyapps.io/activanalyzer); (ii) on PC after installing R software and the activAnalyzer package.

## Installation for using with R

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pydemull/activAnalyzer")
```

## Example

To launch the app using R:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(activAnalyzer)
activAnalyzer::run_app()
```


```{r, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date:
devtools::build_readme()

You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.
