# Overview

activAnalyzer is a shinny app that was developed to analyze physical behavior data recorded at the hip in adults using an ActiGraph accelerometer (.agd files). Once analysis is completed, the app allows to export results (summarized by day and averaged over valid days) to .csv files and to generate a report of the measurement (.pdf file). All the configured inputs relevant for interpreting the results are recorded in the report. Be sure that the inputs that are configured when generating the report correspond to the analysis that was actually performed (in other words, avoid modifying the inputs after generating satisfactory results). Please read the [user's guide](https://github.com/pydemull/activAnalyzer/blob/master/inst/guide/user_guide_en.pdf) for details about how the app works.

# Usage

You can use a stable release of the app via a [shinyapps.io plateform](https://pydemull.shinyapps.io/activAnalyzer/). You can also use the development version on your PC after installing [R software](https://cran.rstudio.com/) and the [activAnalyzer](https://github.com/pydemull/activAnalyzer) package from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pydemull/activAnalyzer")
```

## Example

To launch the app using R:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(activAnalyzer)
activAnalyzer::run_app()
```


```{r, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date:
devtools::build_readme()

You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.
```
