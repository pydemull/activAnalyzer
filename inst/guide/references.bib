  abstract = {Across scientific disciplines, there is a rapidly growing recognition of the need for more statistically robust, transparent approaches to data visualization. Complementary to this, many scientists have called for plotting tools that accurately and transparently convey key aspects of statistical effects and raw data with minimal distortion. Previously common approaches, such as plotting conditional mean or median barplots together with error-bars have been criticized for distorting effect size, hiding underlying patterns in the raw data, and obscuring the assumptions upon which the most commonly used statistical tests are based. Here we describe a data visualization approach which overcomes these issues, providing maximal statistical information while preserving the desired ‘inference at a glance’ nature of barplots and other similar visualization devices. These “raincloud plots” can visualize raw data, probability density, and key summary statistics such as median, mean, and relevant confidence intervals in an appealing and flexible format with minimal redundancy. In this tutorial paper, we provide basic demonstrations of the strength of raincloud plots and similar approaches, outline potential modifications for their optimal use, and provide open-source code for their streamlined implementation in R, Python and Matlab (               https://github.com/RainCloudPlots/RainCloudPlots               ).

  abstract = {Examination of aggregate data on graduate admissions to the University of California, Berkeley, for fall 1973 shows a clear but misleading pattern of bias against female applicants. Examination of the disaggregated data reveals few decision-making units that show statistically significant departures from expected frequencies of female admissions, and about as many units appear to favor women as to favor men. If the data are properly pooled, taking into account the autonomy of departmental decision making, thus correcting for the tendency of women to apply to graduate departments that are more difficult for applicants of either sex to enter, there is a small but statistically significant bias in favor of women. The graduate departments that are easier to enter tend to be those that require more mathematics in the undergraduate preparatory curriculum. The bias in the aggregated data stems not from any pattern of discrimination on the part of admissions committees, which seem quite fair on the whole, but apparently from prior screening at earlier levels of the educational system. Women are shunted by their socialization and education toward fields of graduate study that are generally more crowded, less productive of completed degrees, and less well funded, and that frequently offer poorer professional employment prospects.}

The authors present alternative ways to evidence the relationship between health outcomes and time spent in physical activity and SB and examine how this could be translated into a combined recommendation in future guidelines.               Methods               : We used compositional data analysis to quantify the dose–response associations between the balance of time spent in physical activity and SB with all-cause mortality. The authors applied this approach using 2005–2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey accelerometer data.               Results               : Different combinations of time spent in moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity, light-intensity physical activity, and SB are associated with similar all-cause mortality risk level. A balance of more than 2.5 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity per hour of daily sedentary time is associated with the same magnitude of risk reduction for all-cause mortality as obtained by being physically active according to the current recommendations.               Conclusion               : This method could be applied to provide evidence for more flexible recommendations in the future with options to act on different behaviors depending on individuals’ circumstances and capacity.},

  abstract = {Background: Ankle-brachial index (ABI) at rest is the main clinical tool to diagnose the presence of lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD). The method for ABI procedure (i.e., measurement, calculation and interpretation) is standardised and guidelines were published in 2012. This study sought to: i) assess knowledge about the three major steps of the ABI procedure (i.e., measurement, calculation and interpretation) among residents from different medical schools, ii) compare the ABI knowledge of experienced residents (i.e., who have already performed ABI procedure more than 20 times) with the knowledge of inexperienced residents, and iii) describe the most common errors by residents. Methods: Residents from six medical schools were invited to complete a questionnaire about the ABI procedure. Results: Sixty-eight residents completed the questionnaire. None of them knew how to perform the entire ABI procedure. Overall, 22\,\%, 13\,\% and 41\,\% of residents correctly answered questions about ABI measurement, ABI calculation and ABI interpretation, respectively. Score comparisons underlined the fact that experienced residents (n\,=\,26) answered ABI measurement questions to a significantly better level and had a significantly higher total score than inexperienced residents (n\,=\,42) (P\,=\,0.0485 and P\,=\,0.0332, respectively). Errors were similar for most of the residents. Conclusions: Our study confirms that experienced residents have significantly better ABI procedure knowledge than inexperienced residents. However, none of them are able to perform the entire ABI procedure without any mistake with regard to current guidelines. It is important that training be given to residents in medical schools in order to improve their ABI procedure knowledge.},

Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a highly prevalent disease affecting w202 million people worldwide. ABI is an essential component of medical education because of its ability to diagnose PAD, and as it is a powerful prognostic marker for overall and cardiovascular related mortality. Methods: A systematic search was conducted (up to May 2015) using Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases. Results: Five studies have addressed the impact of a training program on ABI performance by either medical students, doctors or primary care providers. All were assigned a low GRADE system quality. The components of the training vary greatly either in substance (what was taught) or in form (duration of the training, and type of support which was used). No consistency was found in the outcome measures. Conclusion: According to this systematic review, only few studies, with a low quality rating, have addressed which training program should be performed to provide the best way of teaching how to perform ABI. Future high quality researches are required to define objectively the best training program to facilitate ABI teaching and learning.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To develop, assess the feasibility of, and determine the clinical validity of an event‐based analysis method using wearable monitors to quantify walking pain manifestations (WPMs) and stops induced by walking pain (SIWPs) during daily life walking in people with peripheral artery disease (PAD). Methods: The following two conditions were studied: a standardized outdoor walking session (OWS) and a seven‐day free‐living measurement (FLM) period. The PAD participants (n = 23) wore an accelerometer and a watch. They were asked to press the event marker button on the watch to indicate events related to WPMs and SIWPs. To assess the clinical validity of the method, the computed pain‐free walking time (PFWT) and maximal walking time (MWT) were compared with the PFWT and MWT assessed using standard treadmill walking protocols, respectively. Results: Following OWSs, the PFWT[OWS] and MWT[OWS] were significantly correlated with the PFWT[Strandness] (r = .955, P {$<$} .001) and MWT[Strandness] (r = .821, P {$<$} .001), respectively. During the FLM, PAD participants experienced only 2 WPMs/day and 1 SIWP/day, although severely limited on the treadmill and during the OWS. The average WPMs/day were moderately correlated with the PFWT[Strandness] (r = −.54, P = .016). The PFWT[FLM] was on average 12 times longer than the PFWT[Strandness]. Interestingly, the intensity of the walking bouts as assessed by the accelerometer counts during the FLM was significantly lower than that during the OWS (45 ± 15 vs 66 ± 20 counts/s, P {$<$} .001). Conclusion: This new method offers opportunities for studies investigating the experience of living with PAD and the assessment of daily life walking capacity for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.},

  abstract = {Purpose~         The objective of this study is to assess the performance of existing wear/nonwear time classification algorithms for accelerometry data collected in the free-living environment using a wrist-worn triaxial accelerometer and a waist-worn uniaxial accelerometer in older adults.         Methods~         Twenty-nine adults age 76 to 96 yr wore wrist accelerometers for approximately 24 h per day and waist accelerometers during waking for approximately 7 d of free living. Wear and nonwear times were classified by existing algorithms (Alg[ActiLife], Alg[Troiano], and Alg[Choi]) and compared with wear and nonwear times identified by data plots and diary records. With the use of bias and probability of correct classification, the performance of the algorithms, two time windows (60 and 90 min), and vector magnitude (VM) versus vertical axis (V) counts from a triaxial accelerometer were compared.         Results~         Automated algorithms (Alg[Choi] and Alg[Troiano]) classified wear/nonwear time intervals more accurately from VM than V counts. The use of the 90-min time window improved wear/nonwear classification accuracy when compared with the 60-min window. The Alg[Choi] and Alg[Troiano] performed better than the manufacturer-provided algorithm (Alg[ActiLife]), and the Alg[Choi] performed better than the Alg[Troiano] for wear/nonwear time classification using the data collected by both accelerometers.         Conclusions~         Triaxial wrist-worn accelerometer can be used for an accurate wear/nonwear time classification in free-living older adults. The use of the 90-min window and the VM counts improves the performance of commonly used algorithms for wear/nonwear classification for both uniaxial and triaxial accelerometers.},

  abstract = {Introduction:~         The use of movement monitors (accelerometers) for measuring physical activity (PA) in intervention and population-based studies is becoming a standard methodology for the objective measurement of sedentary and active behaviors and for the validation of subjective PA self-reports. A vital step in PA measurement is the classification of daily time into accelerometer wear and nonwear intervals using its recordings (counts) and an accelerometer-specific algorithm.         Purpose:~         The purpose of this study was to validate and improve a commonly used algorithm for classifying accelerometer wear and nonwear time intervals using objective movement data obtained in the whole-room indirect calorimeter.         Methods:~         We conducted a validation study of a wear or nonwear automatic algorithm using data obtained from 49 adults and 76 youth wearing accelerometers during a strictly monitored 24-h stay in a room calorimeter. The accelerometer wear and nonwear time classified by the algorithm was compared with actual wearing time. Potential improvements to the algorithm were examined using the minimum classification error as an optimization target.         Results:~         The recommended elements in the new algorithm are as follows: 1) zero-count threshold during a nonwear time interval, 2) 90-min time window for consecutive zero or nonzero counts, and 3) allowance of 2-min interval of nonzero counts with the upstream or downstream 30-min consecutive zero-count window for detection of artifactual movements. Compared with the true wearing status, improvements to the algorithm decreased nonwear time misclassification during the waking and the 24-h periods (all P values {$<$} 0.001).         Conclusions:~         The accelerometer wear or nonwear time algorithm improvements may lead to more accurate estimation of time spent in sedentary and active behaviors.},

  abstract = {We aimed at showing how Global Positioning System (GPS) along with a previously validated speed processing methodology could be used to measure outdoor walking capacities in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). We also deal with methodological issues that may occur when conducting such measurements, and explore to what extent GPS-measured outdoor walking capacities (maximal walking distance [MWDGPS] and usual walking speed) could be related to traditional functional outcomes (6-min total walking distance) in people with MS. Eighteen people with MS, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale score ≤6, completed a 6-min walking test and an outdoor walking session (60 min maximum) at usual pace during which participants were wearing a DG100 GPS receiver and could perform several walking bouts. Among the 12 participants with valid data (i.e., who correctly completed the outdoor session with no spurious GPS signals that could prevent the detection of the occurrence of a walking/stopping bout), the median (90\% confidence interval, CI) outdoor walking speed was 2.52 km/h (2.17; 2.93). Ten participants (83\% (56; 97)) had ≥1 stop during the session. Among these participants, the median of MWDGPS was 410 m (226; 1350), and 40\% (15; 70) did not reach their MWDGPS during the first walking bout. Spearman correlations of MWDGPS and walking speed with 6-min total walking distance were, respectively, 0.19 (−0.41; 0.95) and 0.66 (0.30; 1.00). Further work is required to provide guidance about GPS assessment in people with MS.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of using speed and grade data obtained from a low-cost global positioning system (GPS) receiver to estimate metabolic rate (MR) during level and uphill outdoor walking. Thirty young, healthy adults performed randomized outdoor walking for 6-min periods at 2.0, 3.5, and 5.0 km/h and on three different grades: 1) level walking, 2) uphill walking on a 3.7\% mean grade, and 3) uphill walking on a 10.8\% mean grade. The reference MR [metabolic equivalents (METs) and oxygen uptake (V̇o               2               )] values were obtained using a portable metabolic system. The speed and grade were obtained using a low-cost GPS receiver (1-Hz recording). The GPS grade (Δ altitude/distance walked) was calculated using both uncorrected GPS altitude data and GPS altitude data corrected with map projection software. The accuracy of predictions using reference speed and grade (actual               [SPEED/GRADE]               ) data was high [ R               2               = 0.85, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.68 MET]. The accuracy decreased when GPS speed and uncorrected grade (GPS               [UNCORRECTED]               ) data were used, although it remained substantial ( R               2               = 0.66, RMSE = 1.00 MET). The accuracy was greatly improved when the GPS speed and corrected grade (GPS               [CORRECTED]               ) data were used ( R               2               = 0.82, RMSE = 0.79 MET). Published predictive equations for walking MR were also cross-validated using actual or GPS speed and grade data when appropriate. The prediction accuracy was very close when either actual               [SPEED/GRADE]               values or GPS               [CORRECTED]               values (for level and uphill combined) or GPS speed values (for level walking only) were used. These results offer promising research and clinical applications related to the assessment of energy expenditure during free-living walking.},

  abstract = {Objective: To investigate the effect of recovery time on walking capacity (WC) throughout repeated maximal walking bouts in symptomatic lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD). Methods: The effect of recovery time on WC (maximal walking time) was determined in 21 PAD participants in three experimental conditions (recovery time from 0.5-9.5 min + a self-selected recovery time [SSRT]): (i) 11 repeated sequences of two treadmill walking bouts (TW-ISO); (ii) a single sequence of seven treadmill walking bouts (TW-CONS); (iii) a single sequence of seven outdoor walking bouts (OW-CONS). Exercise transcutaneous oxygen pressure changes were continuously recorded as an indirect measure of ischemia. An individual recovery time (IRT) beyond which WC did not substantially increase was determined in participants with a logarithmic fit. Results: At the group level, mixed models showed a significant effect (P{$<$}0.001) of recovery time on WC restoration. At the participant level, strong logarithmic relationships were found (median significant R               2               ³0.78). The median SSRT corresponded to a median work-to-rest ratio {$>$}1:1 (i.e., a lower recovery time in view of the corresponding previous walking time) and was related to unrecovered ischemia and a WC restoration level of {$<$}80\%. A median work-to-rest ratio of ≤1:2 allowed full recovery of ischemia and full restoration of WC. The IRT ratio was between 1:1 and 1:2 and corresponded to the start of recovery from ischemia. Conclusion: Recovery time affects the restoration level of WC during repeated maximal walking bouts in symptomatic PAD. Meaningful variations in WC restoration were related to specific levels of work-to-rest ratios.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To determine the best method and combination of methods among global positioning system (GPS), accelerometry, and heart rate (HR) for estimating energy expenditure (EE) during level and graded outdoor walking. Design: Thirty adults completed 6-min outdoor walks at speeds of 2.0, 3.5, and 5.0 km h−1 during three randomized outdoor walking sessions: one level walking session and two graded (uphill and downhill) walking sessions on a 3.4\% and a 10.4\% grade. EE was measured using a portable metabolic system (K4b2). Participants wore a GlobalSat® DG100 GPS receiver, an ActiGraphTM wGT3X+ accelerometer, and a Polar® HR monitor. Linear mixed models (LMMs) were tested for EE predictions based on GPS speed and grade, accelerometer counts or HR-related parameters (alone and combined). Root-mean-square error (RMSE) was used to determine the accuracy of the models. Published speed/grade-, count-, and HR-based equations were also cross-validated. Results: According to the LMMs, GPS was as accurate as accelerometry (RMSE = 0.89–0.90 kcal min−1) and more accurate than HR (RMSE = 1.20 kcal min−1) for estimating EE during level walking; GPS was the most accurate method for estimating EE during both level and uphill (RMSE = 1.34 kcal min−1)/downhill (RMSE = 0.84 kcal min−1) walking; combining methods did not increase the accuracy reached using GPS (or accelerometry for level walking). The cross-validation results were in accordance with the LMMs, except for downhill walking. Conclusions: Our study provides useful information regarding the best method(s) for estimating EE with appropriate equations during level and graded outdoor walking. © 2017 Sports Medicine Australia.

Design               Systematic review and harmonised meta-analysis.                                         Data sources               PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science, Sport Discus from inception to 31 July 2018.                                         Eligibility criteria               Prospective cohort studies assessing physical activity and sedentary time by accelerometry and associations with all cause mortality and reported effect estimates as hazard ratios, odds ratios, or relative risks with 95\% confidence intervals.                                         Data extraction and analysis               Guidelines for meta-analyses and systematic reviews for observational studies and PRISMA guidelines were followed. Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts. One author performed a full text review and another extracted the data. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias. Individual level participant data were harmonised and analysed at study level. Data on physical activity were categorised by quarters at study level, and study specific associations with all cause mortality were analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Study specific results were summarised using random effects meta-analysis.                                         Main outcome measure               All cause mortality.                                         Results               39 studies were retrieved for full text review; 10 were eligible for inclusion, three were excluded owing to harmonisation challenges (eg, wrist placement of the accelerometer), and one study did not participate. Two additional studies with unpublished mortality data were also included. Thus, individual level data from eight studies (n=36\,383; mean age 62.6 years; 72.8\% women), with median follow-up of 5.8 years (range 3.0-14.5 years) and 2149 (5.9\%) deaths were analysed. Any physical activity, regardless of intensity, was associated with lower risk of mortality, with a non-linear dose-response. Hazards ratios for mortality were 1.00 (referent) in the first quarter (least active), 0.48 (95\% confidence interval 0.43 to 0.54) in the second quarter, 0.34 (0.26 to 0.45) in the third quarter, and 0.27 (0.23 to 0.32) in the fourth quarter (most active). Corresponding hazards ratios for light physical activity were 1.00, 0.60 (0.54 to 0.68), 0.44 (0.38 to 0.51), and 0.38 (0.28 to 0.51), and for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were 1.00, 0.64 (0.55 to 0.74), 0.55 (0.40 to 0.74), and 0.52 (0.43 to 0.61). For sedentary time, hazards ratios were 1.00 (referent; least sedentary), 1.28 (1.09 to 1.51), 1.71 (1.36 to 2.15), and 2.63 (1.94 to 3.56).                                         Conclusion               Higher levels of total physical activity, at any intensity, and less time spent sedentary, are associated with substantially reduced risk for premature mortality, with evidence of a non-linear dose-response pattern in middle aged and older adults.

  abstract = {Measures of central tendency including the mean, median, and mode are commonly reported in rehabilitation research. It is believed that the relationship among the mean, median, and mode changes in a specific way when the distribution being analyzed is skewed. A number of widely used textbooks were reviewed to determine how the relationship among the mean, median, and mode is presented in the health sciences and rehabilitation literature. We report a potential misinterpretation of the relationship between measures of central tendency that was identified in several research and statistical textbooks on the subject of rehabilitation. The misinterpretation involves measures of central tendency derived from skewed unimodal sample distributions. The reviewed textbooks state or imply that in asymmetrical distributions, the median is always located between the mode and mean. An example is presented illustrating the fallacy of this assumption. The mean and median will always be to the right of the mode in a positively skewed unimodal distribution and to the left of the mode in a negatively skewed distribution; the order of the mean and median is impossible to predict or generalize. The assumption that the median always falls between the mode and mean in the calculation of coefficients of skewness has implications for the interpretation of exploratory and confirmatory data analysis in rehabilitation research.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The ways in which locations of ischemia and ischemic pain affect spatiotemporal gait parameters and leg electromyographic activity during walking have never been investigated in patients with peripheral arterial disease presenting intermittent claudication. Two groups were classified according to unilateral location of ischemia (distal, n\,=\,10, or proximo-distal, n\,=\,12). Patients described pain and three gait phases—initial pain-free, onset of pain and maximum pain—were analyzed. Patients with proximo-distal ischemia walked less (230\,±\,111~m vs 384\,±\,220~m), with increased step length, step time (+\,5.4\% and\,+\,5.8\%) and reduced cadence (−\,8.2\%), than patients with distal ischemia. In both, the peaks of vertical ground reaction force were reduced in maximum pain (Peak1-distal: −\,11.4\%, Peak1-proximo-distal: −\,10.3\%; Peak2-distal: −\,11.8\%, Peak2-proximo-distal: −\,9.0\%). In the proximo-distal group, tibialis anterior activation peak and time were lower than in the distal group (−\,4.5\% and −\,19.7\%). During the maximum pain phase, this peak decreased only in the proximo-distal group (−\,13.0\%), and gastrocnemius medialis activation peak and time decreased in both groups (−\,2.5\% in distal and −\,4.5\% in proximo-distal). Thus, proximo-distal ischemia leads to more adverse consequences in gait than distal ischemia only. Increasing ischemic pain until maximum, but not onset of pain, induced gait adaptations.},

These formed the basis for the equations used in 1985 FAO/WHO/UNU document,                 Energy and Protein Requirements                 .                              While Schofield's analysis has served a significant role in re-establishing the importance of using basal metabolic rate (BMR) to predict human energy requirements, recent workers have subsequently queried the universal validity and application of these equations. A survey of the most recent studies (1980–2000) in BMR suggests that in most cases the current FAO/WHO/UNU predictive equations overestimate BMR in many communities. The FAO/WHO/UNU equations to predict BMR were developed using a database that contained a disproportionate number – 3388 out of 7173 (47\%) – of Italian subjects. The Schofield database contained relatively few subjects from the tropical region.                                The objective here is to review the historical development in the measurement and application of BMR and to critically review the Schofield                 et al.                 BMR database presenting a series of new equations to predict BMR.                                                        Design               This division, while arbitrary, will enable readers who wish to omit the historical review of BMR to concentrate on the evolution of the new BMR equations.                                         Setting               BMR data collected from published and measured values.                                         Subjects               A series of new equations (Oxford equations) have been developed using a data set of 10 552 BMR values that (1) excluded all the Italian subjects and (2) included a much larger number (4018) of people from the tropics.                                         Results               In general, the Oxford equations tend to produce lower BMR values than the current FAO/WHO/UNU equations in 18–30 and 30–60 year old males and in all females over 18 years of age.                                         Conclusions               This is an opportune moment to re-examine the role and place of BMR measurements in estimating total energy requirements today. The Oxford equations' future use and application will surely depend on their ability to predict more accurately the BMR in contemporary populations.},

  abstract = {Statistical guidelines and expert statements are now available to assist in the analysis and reporting of studies in some biomedical disciplines. We present here a more progressive resource for sample-based studies, meta-analyses, and case studies in sports medicine and exercise science. We offer forthright advice on the following controversial or novel issues: using precision of estimation for inferences about population effects in preference to null-hypothesis testing, which is inadequate for assessing clinical or practical importance; justifying sample size via acceptable precision or confidence for clinical decisions rather than via adequate power for statistical significance; showing SD rather than SEM, to better communicate the magnitude of differences in means and nonuniformity of error; avoiding purely nonparametric analyses, which cannot provide inferences about magnitude and are unnecessary; using regression statistics in validity studies, in preference to the impractical and biased limits of agreement; making greater use of qualitative methods to enrich sample-based quantitative projects; and seeking ethics approval for public access to the depersonalized raw data of a study, to address the need for more scrutiny of research and better meta-analyses. Advice on less contentious issues includes the following: using covariates in linear models to adjust for confounders, to account for individual differences, and to identify potential mechanisms of an effect; using log transformation to deal with nonuniformity of effects and error; identifying and deleting outliers; presenting descriptive, effect, and inferential statistics in appropriate formats; and contending with bias arising from problems with sampling, assignment, blinding, measurement error, and researchers' prejudices. This article should advance the field by stimulating debate, promoting innovative approaches, and serving as a useful checklist for authors, reviewers, and editors.},

  abstract = {The authors investigated the agreement between StepWatch3™ (SW3) and ActiGraph™ wGT3X+ monitors for measuring step-based metrics in patients with peripheral artery disease and older adults. In 23 patients with peripheral artery disease and 38 older participants, the authors compared the metrics obtained during an outdoor (400-m track) walking session (step count) and a 7-day free-living period (step count and 60/30/5/1-min maximal or peak step accumulation) using the SW3 (ankle) and the wGT3X+ (hip) with the low-frequency extension filter enabled (wGT3X+/LFE) or not (wGT3X+/N). During outdoor walking session, agreement was high, particularly for wGT3X+/LFE: correlations ≥.98, median absolute percentage errors {$<$}1\%, and significant equivalence using a\,±\,15\% equivalence zone or narrower. In free living, no wGT3X+ method was equivalent to SW3 for step count. The wGT3X+/LFE was equivalent to SW3 regarding all step accumulation metrics using a\,±\,20\% equivalence zone or narrower, with median absolute percentage errors {$<$}11\%. The wGT3X+/LFE method is the best option for comparisons with SW3 in peripheral artery disease and older adults.}

  abstract = {Effect sizes are the most important outcome of empirical studies. Most articles on effect sizes highlight their importance to communicate the practical significance of results. For scientists themselves, effect sizes are most useful because they facilitate cumulative science. Effect sizes can be used to determine the sample size for follow-up studies, or examining effects across studies. This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA's such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between within- and between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results. Finally, a supplementary spreadsheet is provided to make it as easy as possible for researchers to incorporate effect size calculations into their workflow.}

  abstract = {Three hundred and sixty-three older adults with multiple sclerosis completed a cross-sectional study examining hierarchical correlates of physical activity using a social cognitive theory perspective within a social ecological model (i.e.,~built environment, social environment, and individual social cognitive theory variables). Hierarchical linear regression analyses were conducted, wherein significant associations were noted for built environment (i.e.,~land-use mix diversity and aesthetics) and physical activity in Step 1 (               R               2               \,=\,.09). Social and built environment were significant correlates in Step 2 (               R               2               \,=\,.15). Finally in Step 3, individual social cognitive theory variables (i.e.,~self-efficacy and outcome expectations) were the only significant correlates of total physical activity (               R               2               \,=\,.38). Results were comparable for health-promoting physical activity; however, self-efficacy was the only significant correlate in Step 3 (               R               2               \,=\,.36). This study provides guidance for researchers and practitioners on relevant targets for tailoring interventions for older adults with multiple sclerosis and supports an emphasis on self-efficacy as a primary predictor of health behavior change.},

  abstract = {Figures in scientific publications are critically important because they often show the data supporting key findings. Our systematic review of research articles published in top physiology journals (n = 703) suggests that, as scientists, we urgently need to change our practices for presenting continuous data in small sample size studies. Papers rarely included scatterplots, box plots, and histograms that allow readers to critically evaluate continuous data. Most papers presented continuous data in bar and line graphs. This is problematic, as many different data distributions can lead to the same bar or line graph. The full data may suggest different conclusions from the summary statistics. We recommend training investigators in data presentation, encouraging a more complete presentation of data, and changing journal editorial policies. Investigators can quickly make univariate scatterplots for small sample size studies using our Excel templates.},
